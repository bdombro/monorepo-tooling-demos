# bldr

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun src/bldr-cli.ts
or
npm run watch & node dist/src/bldr-cli.ts
```

bun vs node - bun is faster, has instant start, requires no compile, and control over child_process' stdout behaves better. node is better at debugging bc bun gets confusedÂ with sourcemaps and stack traces sometimes. That will likely get better as bun matures though.
