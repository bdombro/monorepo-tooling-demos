## Comparisons

Legend: ğŸŒ• is supported; ğŸŒ— is semi-supported, ğŸŒ‘ is not supported


### lerna 2.x

lerna is a node application to manage JS monorepos. Version 2x is package-manager agnostic and not maintained.

- Dependency Management
  - ğŸŒ• Cross-reference: can depend on other workspaces
  - ğŸŒ— yarn.lock v1 compat - caveat: hoisting must be disabled
  - ğŸŒ‘ {root}/package.json::override support
  - ğŸŒ• {package}/package.json::override support
  - ğŸŒ‘ constraints: enforce dependency rules (similar to syncpack)
  - ğŸŒ• support private npm repositories
  - ğŸŒ— hoisting - not available except npm package manager
  - ğŸŒ• hoisting: configurable
  - ğŸŒ‘ bootstrap speed: 
- Global scripts
  - ğŸŒ• Install minimal dependencies for workspace + upstream workspaces which depend on it
  - ğŸŒ• Run in multiple workspaces
  - ğŸŒ• Run in glob workspaces
  - ğŸŒ• Run in git-changed workspaces
  - ğŸŒ• Run in workspace + upstream workspaces which are dependencies
  - ğŸŒ• Run in workspace + downstream workspaces which depend on it

### rush (pnpm)

rush is a node application to manage JS monorepos that uses pnpm under the hood. I don't love how heavy it is.

### rush + yarn v1 (unsupported)

pnpm is the default package manager, but it's possible to configure rush to use yarn v1. However, pnpm is the only officially supported and there are bugs.


### turbo + pnpm

turbo is a node application to manage a monorepo, and is compatible with modern versions of npm, yarn and pnpm. It adds more features on top of the package manager, namely caching. Pnpm is my favorite flavor, bc pnpm has more features than the others.
